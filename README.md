# NLP-Based Decision Support for Air Traffic Management

This project explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) can be used to digitize and analyze legacy air traffic management (ATM) text data to support semi-automated decision making for flight operations.

The goal is to transform unstructured historical advisories into structured, actionable information such as Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) classifications, key operational entities, and concise summaries that can assist human decision-makers in safety-critical environments.

This project is motivated by real-world NASA and FAA air traffic management challenges and emphasizes human-in-the-loop AI, interpretability, and robust data pipelines.
